A full stack CRUD Blog app (with commenting logic) made with the MERN stack. 
Users must sign in by creating an account to access the website. Users can create posts, read other users' posts, edit their posts, delete their posts and even add and remove their comments to posts. The site obviously encrypts passwords etc and was designed using stock CSS

**NEW**

- Just implemented some regex to prevent persons from entering email themed usernames as the page might be flagged for phishing. All email themed accounts and their posts and comments in the MongoDB has been removed.

- Updated the styling of the home page
